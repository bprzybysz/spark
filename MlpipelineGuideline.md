I'll help you create a specification for an ML pipeline project using Spark, following best practices. Let me outline a clear, structured guideline that combines PySpark, FastAPI, and modern Python tooling.

1. **Project Structure**:
```
ml-spark-pipeline/
├── pyproject.toml          # Poetry dependency management
├── src/
│   ├── api/               # FastAPI endpoints
│   ├── ml/                # ML pipeline modules
│   ├── config/            # Configuration management
│   └── utils/             # Shared utilities
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks
├── tests/                 # Test suite
└── README.md
```

2. **Core Technologies**:
- PySpark for distributed processing (recommended over plain Spark for Python integration)
- FastAPI + Pydantic for API layer and data validation
- Poetry for dependency management
- Jupyter for interactive development
- MLflow for experiment tracking

3. **Key Dependencies** (for pyproject.toml):
```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
pyspark = "^3.5.0"
fastapi = "^0.109.0"
pydantic = "^2.6.0"
jupyter = "^1.0.0"
mlflow = "^2.10.0"
pandas = "^2.2.0"
scikit-learn = "^1.4.0"
```

4. **Architecture Guidelines**:

a) **Data Layer**:
- Use Pydantic models for data validation
- Implement data versioning
- Store raw data in parquet format for Spark optimization

b) **ML Pipeline**:
- Modular pipeline stages using PySpark ML Pipeline API
- Feature engineering as separate transformers
- Model versioning with MLflow

c) **API Layer**:
- FastAPI endpoints for:
  - Pipeline triggering
  - Model inference
  - Pipeline status monitoring
  - Model metrics

5. **Best Practices**:
- Use type hints throughout
- Implement logging with structured output
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Document using Google-style docstrings
- Use environment variables for configuration

6. **Jupyter Integration**:
- Create template notebooks for:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Model Development
  - Pipeline Testing
  - Results Visualization

7. **Example Pipeline Flow**:
```python
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Data model
class FeatureSet(BaseModel):
    feature_1: float
    feature_2: str
    target: float

# Pipeline definition
def create_pipeline():
    stages = [
        feature_engineering(),
        model_training(),
        evaluation()
    ]
    return Pipeline(stages=stages)

# Spark session with optimized local settings
def get_spark():
    return SparkSession.builder \
        .appName("ML-Pipeline") \
        .config("spark.executor.memory", "4g") \
        .config("spark.driver.memory", "4g") \
        .getOrCreate()
```

8. **Development Workflow**:
- Develop features in Jupyter notebooks
- Refactor into modular Python code
- Test with pytest
- Deploy as FastAPI service
- Monitor with MLflow

9. **Local Spark Optimization**:
- Configure Spark for local mode
- Use memory optimization for M1/ARM
- Enable Arrow for pandas-spark conversion
- Cache intermediate results appropriately

10. **Monitoring & Logging**:
- Use MLflow for experiment tracking
- Implement structured logging
- Monitor system resources
- Track model metrics

This specification provides a solid foundation for building a production-ready ML pipeline that can be developed locally and scaled as needed. The combination of PySpark, FastAPI, and Jupyter notebooks ensures both development flexibility and production reliability.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or provide more detailed implementation examples for any part of this specification?
